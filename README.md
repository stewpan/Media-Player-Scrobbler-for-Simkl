## ⚡ Quick Start

- **Windows:** Use the [Windows Guide](docs/windows-guide.md) (EXE installer, tray app, no commands needed).
- **Linux:** Use the [Linux Guide](docs/linux-guide.md) (pipx recommended, tray app, setup command needed).
- **macOS:** Use the [Mac Guide](docs/mac-guide.md) (pip install, tray app, setup command needed, untested).

After installation, authenticate with SIMKL and **configure your media players** using the [Media Players Guide](docs/media-players.md) (this step is critical for accurate tracking).

Once it's running, open the **local web dashboard** from the tray (**Open Dashboard**) or at [`http://127.0.0.1:5555`](http://127.0.0.1:5555) for a live view of what's playing, your history, and settings — see the [Web Dashboard guide](docs/web-dashboard.md).

A built-in **local web dashboard** ([`http://127.0.0.1:5555`](http://127.0.0.1:5555)) surfaces live now-playing status, your watch history, and settings in the browser. See the [Web Dashboard guide](docs/web-dashboard.md).
