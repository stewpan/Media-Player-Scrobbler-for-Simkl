## 📊 Local Watch History Viewer

A new local watch history page is available! Open the `watch-history-viewer` folder in your browser to:
- Browse all your watched movies, TV shows, and anime
- Search, filter, and sort your history
- View statistics and trends (charts, breakdowns)
- Switch between grid/list views and dark/light themes

See [Local Watch History](watch-history.md) for full details.

## 🌐 Web Dashboard

MPS for SIMKL also runs a small **local web dashboard** in your browser while the app is
running. Open it from the tray menu (**Open Dashboard**) or visit
**`http://127.0.0.1:5555`**.

- **Dashboard** — live "now playing" with progress, plus your watch-count stats.
- **History** — search and filter everything you've watched.
- **Settings** — completion threshold, notifications, auto-sync interval, directory
  filters, and Simkl sign-in (a browser-based PIN flow).

The dashboard is **localhost-only** (reachable only from this computer) and needs no
password. You can change the port or turn it off with the `web_ui_port` / `web_ui_enabled`
settings. If you installed from source rather than a packaged build, build the UI once with
`cd webui && npm install && npm run build`.

See the [Web Dashboard guide](web-dashboard.md) for full details.

## 🔔 Tray Status Icons

MPS for SIMKL uses the system tray/notification area to show its current status across all platforms:

| Icon | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| ![Running](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-running.png) | **Running** | App is actively monitoring and ready to track media playback |
| ![Paused](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-paused.png) | **Paused** | Tracking is temporarily paused, no new media will be scrobbled |
| ![Stopped](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-stopped.png) | **Stopped** | App is inactive and not tracking (but still running in tray) |
| ![Error](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-error.png) | **Error** | There's an issue with the app (authentication, API, etc.) |

Right-click the tray icon to access the app menu with the following sections:

**Main Actions:**
