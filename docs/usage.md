## 📺 TV Shows & Anime Tracking

MPS for SIMKL now supports automatic tracking of TV shows and anime, in addition to movies.

- TV show and anime episodes are detected and scrobbled as you watch them in supported players.
- All types (movies, shows, anime) appear in your local and online history.
- For best results, use clear filenames (e.g. `Show.Name.S01E02.mkv` or `Anime.Title.12.mp4`).
- See the [Media Players Guide](media-players.md) for player-specific setup.

## 📊 Local Watch History Viewer

A new local watch history page is available! Open the `watch-history-viewer` folder in your browser to:
- Browse all your watched movies, TV shows, and anime
- Search, filter, and sort your history
- View statistics and trends (charts, breakdowns)
- Switch between grid/list views and dark/light themes

See [Local Watch History](watch-history.md) for full details.

## 🔔 Tray Status Icons

MPS for SIMKL uses the system tray/notification area to show its current status across all platforms:

| Icon | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| ![Running](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-running.png) | **Running** | App is actively monitoring and ready to track media playback |
| ![Paused](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-paused.png) | **Paused** | Tracking is temporarily paused, no new media will be scrobbled |
| ![Stopped](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-stopped.png) | **Stopped** | App is inactive and not tracking (but still running in tray) |
| ![Error](../simkl_mps/assets/simkl-mps-error.png) | **Error** | There's an issue with the app (authentication, API, etc.) |

Right-click the tray icon to access the app menu with options to:
- Start/stop/pause monitoring
- View currently detected media
- Access settings
- **Tools:**
  - **Try Scrobble Again:** Clears cache for the active file and attempts to re-identify and scrobble it. Use when the wrong title/episode appears.
  - **Process Backlog Now:** Immediately replays any offline scrobbles waiting in backlog.
  - **Watch Threshold (%):** Quickly switch between preset watch thresholds or define a custom percentage.
- **Developer Controls:**
  - **Open Logs / Open Config Directory:** Jump straight to app diagnostics from the tray.
  - **Clear Logs:** Truncates application and playback logs so you can capture a fresh session before debugging.
  - **Clear Watch History:** Removes the local `watch_history.json` file and viewer data without touching your SIMKL account.
  - **Clear Backlog:** Deletes pending offline scrobbles to stop repeated sync prompts.
  - **Clear Cache:** Removes local media cache data while keeping logs and settings intact.
  - **Clear All Data and Logs:** Performs a full reset—use only when you want a clean re-authentication; the app exits afterward.
- Exit the application
